\usage{
get_flows(
  geography,
  variables = NULL,
  year = 2018,
  output = "tidy",
  state = NULL,
  county = NULL,
  cbsa = NULL,
  geometry = FALSE,
  key = NULL,
  moe_level = 90,
  show_call = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{geography}{The geography of your requested data. Possible values are
`"county"`, `"county subdivision"`, and `"cbsa"`.}

\item{variables}{Character string or vector of character strings of variable
names. By default, `get_flows()` returns the GEOID and names of the
geographies as well as the number of people who moved in and out of each
geography (`MOVEDIN` and `MOVEDOUT`). If additional variables are
specified, they are pulled in addition to the default variables.}

\item{year}{The year, or endyear, of the ACS sample. The Migration Flows API
is available for 5-year ACS samples from 2010 to 2018. Defaults to 2018.}

\item{output}{One of "tidy" (the default) in which each row represents an
enumeration unit-variable combination, or "wide" in which each row
represents an enumeration unit and the variables are in the columns.}

\item{state}{An optional vector of states for which you are requesting data.
State names, postal codes, and FIPS codes are accepted. When requesting
county subdivision data, you must specify at least one state. Defaults to
NULL.}

\item{county}{The county for which you are requesting data. County names and
FIPS codes are accepted. Must be combined with a value supplied to `state`.
Defaults to NULL.}

\item{cbsa}{The core-based statistical area (metropolitan/micropolitan
statistical area) for which you are requesting data. Specify a single value
or a vector of values to get data for more than one CBSA. Numeric or
character CBSA GEOIDs are accepted. When specifying CBSAs, geography must
be set to `"cbsa"` and `state` and `county` must be `NULL`. Defaults to
NULL.}

\item{geometry}{if FALSE (the default), return a tibble of ACS Migration
Flows data. If TRUE, return an sf object with the centroids of both origin
and destination as `sfc_POINT` columns. The origin point feature is
returned in a column named `centroid1` and is the active geometry column in
the sf object. The destination point feature is returned in the `centroid2`
column.}

\item{key}{Your Census API key. Obtain one at
\url{http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html}}

\item{moe_level}{The confidence level of the returned margin of error.  One
of 90 (the default), 95, or 99.}

\item{show_call}{if TRUE, display call made to Census API. This can be very
useful in debugging and determining if error messages returned are due to
tidycensus or the Census API. Copy to the API call into a browser and see
what is returned by the API directly. Defaults to FALSE.}
